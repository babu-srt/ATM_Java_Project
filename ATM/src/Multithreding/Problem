Multithreding : Is a process to execute multiple thread at the same time without *dependency* of other thread is called multithrading

Thread : Is a pre-define class which is available in lang package
        Thread is basic or smallest unit of CPU and it is well known for independent Execution

        There are 2 ways to create thread in java
        1) Extending Thread class
        2) Implimenting Runable Interface
1: Process based multithreding
  -Multiple CPU
  -Multiple application
  -Multiple function in single applicaiton
2: tread based multithreding
   -Multiple application
   -Multiple function in single applicaiton
   -Multiple users in single function


                        ***********************   Synchronize ******************************

  - Synchronization in a tech through which we can control multiple threads or among the number of thread
  - Only one thread will enter in syncronized area
  - The main perpose of synchronization is to overcome the problem of multithreding
  - When multiple threas are trying to access same resources at the same time on that situation it may provide wrong reult or corrupted data
  - Synchronization is broadly classified in 2 categories 1)method level 2)block level(beat approach)

  Multithreding is very good when ever we want to complete our task as soon as possible but in some situation it may provide some wrong result
  this type of situation occur when same resoure is accesible by multiple thred at the same time




                         ************************ Method Level Synchronization ***********************

- In the Java every object have a only one lock and this lock can be given to only one thread at allthe time
- In Method level Synchronization the entire method is Synchronized so only one thread will enter the Synchronized
  are and remaining all the thread will wait at method level


                         ************************ Block Level Synchronization ***********************

- In Method level Synchronization the entire method is not get Synchronize only one part of method sunchronize
  we have to enclose those fe lines in synchronize block
